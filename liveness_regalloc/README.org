Canonize + instruction selection

* grader read
+ We are using funcgraph to implement flowgraph and interference graph instead of original graph provided by textbook
+ 

* new file added

| name          | description                                         |
| makegraph.sml | need to implement "instrs2graph" method             |
| liveness.sml  | need to implement "interferenceGraph" and "show"    |

* todo

** Liveness
done: implement MakeGraph structure (add nodes, edges to make a complete flowgraph)
done: implement Liveness structure (computer live_in and live_out map for each node, make an interference graph)



** Reg Allocation
