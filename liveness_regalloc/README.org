#+TODO: TODO INPROCESS UNSURE DONE

Canonize + instruction selection

* grader read
+ We are using funcgraph to implement flowgraph and interference graph instead of original graph provided by textbook
+

* new file added

| makegraph.sml | need to implement "instrs2graph" method             |
| liveness.sml  | need to implement "interferenceGraph" and "show"    |

* todo

** Liveness
done: implement MakeGraph structure (add nodes, edges to make a complete flowgraph)
done: implement Liveness structure (computer live_in and live_out map for each node, make an interference graph)



** Reg Allocation

* issue

** TODO 1 precolored nodes

The initial precolored nodes is obtained by:
#+BEGIN_SRC
val precolored = IntSet.difference (nodeSet, initialTempSet)
#+END_SRC

Nodes in the graph - intial temps that are not colored

rather than set it to the 32 machine registers, is this correct ?

I set K to be the length of precolored nodes, is it correct ?
