Convert sml compiler to executable file

We use mlton compiler to compile out sml code into binary executable.

The commands used are as below:

#+BEGIN_SRC
mlton -output compile sources.mlb
#+END_SRC



* run with binary file

#+BEGIN_SRC
.compile temp
#+END_SRC

The above will compile the temp tiger into mips commands named as temp.s
