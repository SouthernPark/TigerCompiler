* conflicts

This section includes shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts we currently have and how we solve it.

Conflicts usually happens in operator precedence. Below is the precedence of operator defined by the book:

Unary minus (negation) has the highest precedence. Then operators *,/ have the next highest (tightest binding) precedence, followed by +,-, then by \=,<>,>,<,>=,<=, then by &, then by |.

The operators * , / , + , - are all left-associative. The comparison operators do not associate, so a=b=c is not a legal expression, although a= (b=c) is legal.


** shift-refuce conflicts

*** PLUS and MINUS operator (associative property)

We have the following grammar for plus and minus operator
#+BEGIN_SRC
exp -> exp + exp
exp -> exp - exp
#+END_SRC

They may cause the following states:

#+BEGIN_SRC

exp -> exp + exp .
exp -> exp . + exp

exp -> exp - exp .
exp -> exp . - exp

#+END_SRC

For plus and minus operator we want left associativity (1+2+3 => (1+2) + 3). So we should use %left in Yacc to denote this.

And they should have the same precedence (1+2-3 => (1+2)-3 and 1-2+3 => (1-2)+3). So we write them in the same line.

This will lead to the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC

%left PLUS MINUS

#+END_SRC


*** TIMES and DIVIDE operator (associative property and precedence)
We have the following grammar for times and divide operator
#+BEGIN_SRC
exp -> exp * exp
exp -> exp / exp
#+END_SRC

They may cause the following states:

#+BEGIN_SRC

exp -> exp * exp .
exp -> exp . * exp

exp -> exp / exp .
exp -> exp . / exp

#+END_SRC

For tmies and divide operator we want left associativity (1*2*3 => (1*2) * 3). So we should use %left in Yacc to denote this.

Also, they should have higer precedence than PLUS operator. In Yacc, we write them after PLUS to sppecify this.

This will lead to the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC

%left PLUS MINUS
%left TIMES DIVIDE

#+END_SRC


*** MINUS Unary operator

In 1-2 and 1+2-3, we use the exp -> exp - exp rule to handle minus. But what about -2*3, which should be evaluated as (-2)*3 instead of -(2*3).

We have the following grammar for times and divide operator
#+BEGIN_SRC
exp -> - exp
#+END_SRC

Minus unary usually happens when - is the first operator in the expression.

Unary operator should have higer priority than any other operators. But MINUS is also used in exp - exp. To solve this, we use %prec. (From doc: The optional %prec consists of the keyword %prec followed by a terminal whose precedence should be used as the precedence of the rule.)

So we could have the following in ML-yacc:
#+BEGIN_SRC text

  exp: MINUS exp %prec MINUS				()

#+END_SRC



*** other operators
Given the precedence definition from the book, we have have the following ML-Yacc definition:

#+BEGIN_SRC

%left OR
%left AND
%nonassoc EQ NEQ GT LT GE LE
%left PLUS MINUS
%left TIMES DIVIDE

exp: MINUS exp %prec MINUS                            ()

#+END_SRC


*** TODO Conflict in array creation and math operator

We get the following shift-reduce conflict between the "OF" terminal and math operator, as shown below:

#+BEGIN_SRC
state 101:

        exp : ID LBRACK exp RBRACK OF exp .  (reduce by rule 11)
        opexp : exp . PLUS exp
        opexp : exp . MINUS exp
        opexp : exp . TIMES exp
        opexp : exp . DIVIDE exp
        opexp : exp . EQ exp
        opexp : exp . NEQ exp
        opexp : exp . LT exp
        opexp : exp . LE exp
        opexp : exp . GT exp
        opexp : exp . GE exp

#+END_SRC

The "OF" operator should have weeker precedence than PLUS, MINUS ... GE. We could use /%nonassoc OF/ to handle this.

**** TODO Is there any other way to handle this ? (do not use precedence)


*** TODO Conflict in between lvalue and record, array , call expression

The rule result the conflicts is:
#+BEGIN_SRC text

  exp : lvalue
      | ID LBRACE recfields RBRACE
      | ID LBRACK exp RBRACK OF exp
      | funcallexp

  lvalue : ID

  funcallexp : ID LPAREN args RPAREN

#+END_SRC

will lead to the following state:

#+BEGIN_SRC
error:  state 11: shift/reduce conflict (shift LBRACK, reduce by rule 36)

state 11:

        exp : ID . LBRACE recfields RBRACE
        exp : ID . LBRACK exp RBRACK OF exp
        lvalue : ID .  (reduce by rule 36)
        funcallexp : ID . LPAREN args RPAREN

#+END_SRC

how to solve this conflict ?

It seems that every time we saw ID followed by something, we'd like to treat it as String rather than reduce it to lvalue (which is reduced to A.var)

* File explaination

* ML-Yacc note

** ML-Yacc grammar

http://www.smlnj.org/doc/ML-Yacc/mlyacc002.html

in "2.2 Grammar"

** %value

Specifies default values for value-bearing terminals.Terminals with default values may be created by an ml-yacc-generated parser as part of error-correction.

** %term

Specifies the terminals of the language. ml-yacc automatically constructs a Tokens module based on this specification.

Tokens specified without "of" will have a constructor of two args: (1) its left position and (2) its right position.

Tokens specified with "of" will have a constructor of three args: (1) the component datum (whose type follows "of"); (2) its left position; and (3) its the right position.

These args can be used in the semantic action part.

*** DONE How to use args in semantic action part?

for each terminal or nonterminal such as F00 or F001 on the right-hand side of a rule, the ML variable FOOleft or FOOlleft stands for the left-end position of the terminal or nonterminal, and FOOright or F001right stands for the right-end position.

terminal itself stands for the data assiciated with it. For example, for the "ID of string", you can use ID to get string data.

** %nonterm

"A of B" specifies the non-terminal A of the language and the kind of value B that the parser will generate for them

ex:

In "program of A.exp", program is a non-termianl and A.exp is a datatype defined in absyn.sml

non-termianl can also be used in the semantic action part.

*** DONE How to use them in semantic action part?

the non-terminal itself stands itself stands for the value it can generate by the parser

** %name
prefix some names (like functor name) created by ml-yacc

** %pos
The type of postions for terminals


* Issues

** not solved

*** TODO escape field

Do not unsderstand the escape field defined in many datatypes in "absyn.sml".

*** TODO (symbol * pos) option

Is the pos for ID ?



*** TODO vardec nil init must use long form
The following is the abstract syntax of vardec
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  vardec -> var id := exp
	 -> var id:type_id := exp

#+END_SRC

If the initializing expression is nil(NilExp), then the long form must be used.

Do we need to report error in parsing phase.

*** TODO sequence expression

The book defined sequence expression as: A sequence of *two or more* expressions, surrounded by parentheses and separated by semicolons (exp; exp; ... exp).

So (exp) will not be sequence expression ?

So the grammar could be written as /exp ; exp {;exp}/

For (exp) we will just regard it as exp. So we get the following code in Yacc to handle this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  exp : LPAREN exp RPAREN                                                 (exp)
      | LPAREN seqexp RPAREN                                              (A.SeqExp(seqexp))

  seqexp : exp SEMICOLON exp seqexpTail                                   ((exp1, exp1left)::(exp2, exp2left)::seqexpTail)

  seqexpTail : SEMICOLON exp seqexpTail                                   ((exp, expleft) :: seqexpTail)
	     |                                                            (nil)
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Array and record assignment vs Normal Assignment

Array and record assignment: when an array or record variable a is assigned a value b, then a references the same array or record as b

Normal assignment: The assignment statement lvalue : = exp evaluates the lvalue, then evaluates the exp, then sets the contents of the lvalue to the result of the expression. Syntactically, := binds weaker than the boolean operators & and |. The assignment expression produces no value, so that (a: =b) +c is illegal


Array and record assignment seems to be a lvalue to lvalue assignment, while normal assignment seems to be a lvalue to exp assignment.

***** TODO How to handle := binds weaker than & and |
exp: a := true & false should be parsed as a := (true & false) instead of (a := true) & false

Seems assignment operator is non-associative like a := b := c is illegal (assignment expression produces no value).

Maybe we can use /%nonassoc ASSIGN/ to handle this ?


** solved


*** DONE mutual recusive func dec and type dec

Mutual recusive func and type can only be defined in consecutive declarations.

So in absyn.sml, the TypeDec (and FunctionDec) constructor of the abstract syntax takes a list of type declarations, not just a single type. The intent is that this list is a maximal consecutive sequence of type declarations. Thus, functions declared by the same TypeDec can be mutually recursive.

how to achieve this ?

Drew suggests get the wrong decs first, then in let expression we fix all the wrong decs.

For example: at first we have:

decs = {fundec, fundec, vardec, tydec, tydec}

after reduction form let expression (let ... in ... end), we fix this and decs become

decs = {fundec，vardec, tydec}

The following code demonstrate how to fix decs

#+BEGIN_SRC

(* mergeLst ([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) => [1,2,3,4,5,6] *)
fun mergeLst (l1, l2) = foldr (op ::) l2 l1

(* merge FunctionDec and  TypeDec as long as they are consecutive*)
(* ex: fixDecs([fd,fd,vd,vd,td,td]) => [fd, vd, vd, td]*)
fun fixDecs ((A.FunctionDec lst1) :: (A.FunctionDec lst2) ::l) = fixDecs(A.FunctionDec(mergeLst(lst1, lst2)) :: l)
  | fixDecs ((A.TypeDec lst1) :: (A.TypeDec lst2) ::l) = fixDecs(A.TypeDec(mergeLst(lst1, lst2)) :: l)
  | fixDecs (a::l) = a :: fixDecs(l)
  | fixDecs [] = []

#+END_SRC


*** shift reduce conflict in tyfields

The following gramma has shift reduce conflict.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
tyfields: ID COLON ID                                                 ()
        | ID COLON ID COMMA tyfields                                  ()
        |                                                             ()
#+END_SRC

We translate into the following (factoring) :

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  tyfields: ID COLON ID tyfieldsTail				()
	  |    	      						()

  tyfieldsTail: COMMA ID COLON ID tyfieldsTail			()
	      | 	    						()
#+END_SRC


*** funcallexp
The funcallexp has the following declarations:
#+BEGIN_SRC
funcallexp -> id()
funcallexp -> id(exp{,exp})  # {,exp} means repeat ",exp" zero or more times
#+END_SRC

Inintially, I get the following code for this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  funcallexp : ID LPAREN funcallTail		()

  funcallTail : RPAREN   				()
	      | exp COMMA funcallTail		()
#+END_SRC

which is incorrect cause it can not express "func(1)" (it can expree func(1,) but not func(1)).

The above is also incorret because it can match (func(1,2,) which should be illegal)

Below maybe a good practice to write it:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  funcallexp : ID LPAREN RPAREN				()
	     | ID LPAREN exp funcallTail			()

  funcallTail : RPAREN   	   				()
	      | COMMA exp funcallTail			()
#+END_SRC

The above could match "func()", "func(1)", "func(1,2)".

And will not match illegal function calls like "func(1,)", "func(1,2,)" ...

Another approach would be:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  funcallexp : ID LPAREN args RPAREN			()

  args : exp argsTail     				()
       | 	   						()

  argsTail : COMMA  exp argsTail				()
	   | 	     					()

#+END_SRC
The good aspect of this practive is args can be reused later.
This approach is also used to define record type as below:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  ty : LBRACE tyfields RBRACE					()

  tyfields: ID COLON ID tyfieldsTail				()
	  |    	      						()

  tyfieldsTail: COMMA ID COLON ID tyfieldsTail			()
	      | 	       	     					()


#+END_SRC

record type grammar is as below:

#+BEGIN_SRC

ty -> { tyfields }

tyfields -> id:type_id {, id:type_id}

#+END_SRC

Both of these two approaches will not cause conflicts.

#+END_SRC

you didn't define the output type of tydec in %non-term.

*** 3
In "tiger.grm.desc", we have the following error:

warning: rule <let_ : LET decs IN exp END > will never be reduced. This means this rule can not be reached from the start state. This happens because we did not connect the exp with let_ state. To solve this proble, we move the rule to exp.

*** TODO typedec require list

#+BEGIN_SRC

tiger.grm.sml:240.6-240.62 Error: operator and operand do not agree [tycon mismatch]

val it = false : bool

#+END_SRC

The TypeDec constructor of the abstract syntax takes a list of type declarations, not just a single type. The intent is that this list is a maximal consecutive sequence of type declarations. Thus, functions declared by the same TypeDec can be mutually recursive.

currently each dec list only contains one dec. In later phase, we will fix the decs.

Drew suggests get the wrong decs first, then in let expression we fix all the wrong decs.

For example: at first we have:

decs = {fundec, fundec, vardec, tydec, tydec}

after reduction form let expression (let ... in ... end), we fix this and decs become

decs = {fundec，vardec, tydec}
